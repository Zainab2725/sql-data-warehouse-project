# SQL Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to my SQL Data Warehouse Project! This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and utilization of a robust data warehouse to support analytics and decision-making across various types of data.

## Project Description
This project involves building a SQL-based Data Warehouse that centralizes data from multiple sources. It uses ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to clean, transform, and load data into structured tables. Dimensional modeling concepts, including star and snowflake schemas, are applied to optimize query performance and enable comprehensive analysis.

## Project Requirements
- SQL Server or any relational database management system
- Sample datasets from different domains (e.g., operations, customer info, transactions, IoT, or organizational data)
- ETL tools or SQL scripts for data transformation
- Reporting or visualization tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, or SQL-based reports)

## Analytics and Reporting
The warehouse enables advanced analytics such as:
- Identifying trends and patterns across datasets
- Monitoring operational metrics and KPIs
- Analyzing user or organizational behavior
- Supporting data-driven decision-making

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide a centralized, structured repository of organizational data that supports efficient reporting, analysis, and informed decision-making across various domains.
