# Data Warehouse 

## Welcome
Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a modern data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights best practices in **data engineering, ETL pipelines, and analytics**.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**:

- **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV, JSON, or other structured files into SQL Server.  
- **Silver Layer:** Data cleansing, normalization, and standardization are performed here to prepare data for analytics.  
- **Gold Layer:** Contains business-ready data, modeled into a **star schema**, optimized for reporting and decision-making.

## 📖 Project Overview
This project includes the following phases:  

- **Data Architecture:** Designing a modern data warehouse using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.  
- **ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.  
- **Data Modeling:** Creating fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.  
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Building SQL-based reports and dashboards to deliver actionable insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The objectives of this project are:  

- Build a centralized data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate organizational data.  
- Enable efficient analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.  
- Implement ETL pipelines and dimensional modeling best practices for high-quality data.  

---

## 🛠️ Project Requirements
- **Database:** SQL Server or any relational database management system  
- **Datasets:** Sample organizational datasets (e.g., operational records, logs, or transactional data)  
- **ETL Tools:** SQL scripts or ETL platforms for data cleansing and transformation  
- **Reporting Tools:** Power BI, Tableau, or SQL-based dashboards for visualization
